# Neural Network Trading Bot
C++ implementation of artifical neural network to analyze BTC-e trade data
Uses python3 to executes trade predictions output by the neural network on the BTC-e exchange
All data records are stored sqlite databases

trade_stream.py            
	Sends HTTP request to BTC-e public API every 2 seconds to gather recent trade data
trading_floor.py           
	Checks output.sqlite for new records inserted by neural-network-predictor and executes orders to BTC-e if various criteria are met
neural-network-predictor (executable)   
	Inserts records into output.sqlite containing the current price, predicted price, and type of trade to execute 

neural-network-predictor configuration variables:
	main.cpp -> eta_ -> overall net training rate of the neural network [0.0...1.0]
	main.cpp -> alpha_ -> momentum multiplier [0.0...n]
	main.cpp -> topology -> determines the topology of each layer of the neural network
	training.h -> subset_length = determines the length of each array used by the neural network for training
	training.h -> input_data_file_ = set this to be your local path to neural-net-trading-bot/data/input.sqlite
		NOTE - input.sqlite is generated by neural-net-trading-bot/pyTrader/trade_stream.py
	exchange.h -> output_data_file_ = set this to be your local path to neural-net-trading-bot/data/output.sqlite
		NOTE - output.sqlite is generated by neural-net-trading-bot/neural-network-predictor

Usage:
	trade_stream.py, trading_floor.py, and neural-network-predictor all must be run in seperate terminal windows
	Execute programs in following order: trade_stream.py, trading_floor.py, neural-network-predictor

	neural-network-predictor will automatically proceed with execution when subset_length * 10 records are present in input.sqlite
	trade_stream.py will automatically proceed with execution once records are present in output.sqlite
